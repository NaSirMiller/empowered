# Problem Setup

## Number of States

Obviously we want all 50 states.

## Number of Cities

~19000 total.

(If needed) Based on population:

- 35 for the biggest cities
- 35 for the mid-sized cities (median)
- 35 for the smaller cities

## Number of features

There are 120 relevant features.

So we will have 19000 datapoints (each city in the US) and will be comparing them to each other w.r.t 120 features.
